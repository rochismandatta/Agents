CrewAI Agents with Groq API
==========================

CrewAI Agents is a powerful research tool that leverages AI agents to conduct comprehensive analysis and generate strategic insights based on user input. This project combines the capabilities of the Groq API, DuckDuckGo search, and Streamlit to create an interactive web application.

Features
--------

* Three specialized AI agents: Researcher, Consultant, and Author
* Agents generate tasks based on user input and perform web searches to gather relevant information
* Agents extract text from articles, determine relevance to the task, and generate summaries
* Multiple search iterations to find the most relevant information
* Final report generated by combining the results from all agents
* User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
